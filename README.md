# Go-Local
It is a web application that helps users book vehicles available for them to drive around the city. When the user opens the application and signs in or signs up, the closest vehicle will be assigned and they can choose to accept the vehicle. Once accepted, the payment-meter will start and when the user wishes to end the ride, the cost will be calculated by the time and will alert them.
